SIMPLE SITE
-----------
A Simple Website Management Tool or CMS.

Aimed at users with limited Web experience, this application will help them
manage the content of their site while also restricting them to strict templates
managed by the web developer/designer(s)

Simple Site should not allow the user to get lost or screw up their site by unknowingly
entering bad HTML. It will also help the user keep their site looking as good as 
those original design visuals buy limiting their input. 

If they really want a 'cool new page layout', back to the design brief we go as the
designer/developer creates a new template to fit these need.
